    <h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>DNS Monitoring: Shows all DNS queries in the system.</li>
      <li>IP-Intelligence: Monitors outbound connections (tcp/udp) and checks it against threat intelligence lists. Includes script to pull down public threat feeds.</li>
    </ul>

  <section id="usage">
    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>This tool monitors outbound connections (tcp/udp, ipv4 only) and checks it against threat intelligence lists. There is a script included that pulls down two public feeds, the list of active tor exit nodes and Talos' IP blacklist. Just run ./update_feeds.sh in the root directory of this project and it'll populate the ip_feeds/ directory. You can add your own lists to that directory as well.</p>
